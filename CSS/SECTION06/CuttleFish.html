    <h1>Cuttlefish</h1>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish, or cuttles, are
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean">marine</a>
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mollusca">molluscs</a> of the
      suborder Sepiina. They belong to the class Cephalopoda which also includes
      squid, octopuses, and nautiluses. Cuttlefish have a unique internal shell,
      the cuttlebone, which is used for control of buoyancy.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cuttlefish have large, W-shaped pupils, eight arms, and two tentacles
      furnished with denticulated suckers, with which they secure their prey.
      They generally range in size from 15 to 25 cm (6 to 10 in), with the
      largest species, the giant cuttlefish (Sepia apama), reaching 50 cm (20
      in) in
      <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mantle_(mollusc)">mantle</a> length
      and over 10.5 kg (23 lb) in mass. <sup>[1]</sup>

    <h2>Etymology</h2>
    <p>
      "Cuttle" in "cuttlefish", sometimes called "cuttles",[3] is derived from
      the Old English name for the species, cudele. The word may be cognate with
      the Old Norse koddi (cushion) and the Middle Low German Kudel (rag).
